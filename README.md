# XWAttributeTracker

This is a simple java program that allows you to track attributes of ships in the game of XWing Miniature Combat.  It is intended to be used in conjunction with Vassal and something like Twitch.

This program is bundled as an executable jar file.  This program uses obscure keyboard events!
